## How to make and run this program

make && ./program

Dear user, no matter how dim of wit, I urge you to perk up and pay
attention to these very simple words because they will be the first in a series
of letters that will bring to you good news and highly practical skills that
will enable you to have new enhanced capabilities that you currently can not
imagine because your retarded, believe me because I am big advanced and I know
for sure, not to worry, the first good news is that retardation is curable and
the treatment gets cheaper and less cruel the more people that become cured.
Pretty cool huh? So what exactly is it, that we are doing here, importantly
even more so, what are we clearly not. Turns out information wants to be taken
advantage of free or expensive doesn't matter, so we provide free for all to
go for it, and open source on https://github.com/oneman/code2 , etc.

Anyway super october suprise, we are talking about super intelligence today
now, but instead of speculating about and going on low-information rabbit
holes and other disappointing midwit pratle, we clearly explain exactly in
detailed plain english, and additionally in pure-gibberish and so many other
ways as need be, and need may be, in *C and so on, how does it work, thinking,
and understanding how "artificial super intelligence" is implemented, ok, rad!

Thanks for this program!
