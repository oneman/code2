<h1>🔮Personal Superintelligence</h1>
<p>Over the last few months (🌜🌝🌚🌝🌚🌝🌚🌛) we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves.
The improvement is slow for now, (🙈🐣💩👀🧑‍🦱) but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight. (🔭 🪄 🧠 ✨ 🤖)</p>
<p>It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable
the creation and discovery of new things that aren't imaginable today. But it is an open question
what we will direct superintelligence towards.</p>
<p class="r">∗∎</p>
<p>In some ways this will be a new era for humanity, but in others it's just a continuation of
historical trends. As recently as 200 years ago, 90% of people were farmers growing food to
survive. Advances in technology have steadily freed much of humanity to focus less on subsistence
and more on the pursuits we choose. At each step, people have used our newfound productivity to
achieve more than was previously possible, pushing the frontiers of science and health, as well
as spending more time on creativity, culture, relationships, and enjoying life.</p>
<p>I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of
progress. But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin
a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in
the directions they choose.</p>
<p>As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on
our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you
achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a
better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.</p>
<p>Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this
power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.</p>
<p>This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed
centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its
output. At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have
always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture. This will be increasingly
important in the future as well.</p>
<p>The intersection of technology and how people live is Meta's focus, and this will only become
more important in the future.</p>
<p>If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and
more time creating and connecting. Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands
our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful. Personal devices like
glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and
interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.</p>
<p>We believe the benefits of superintelligence should be shared with the world as broadly as
possible. That said, superintelligence will raise novel safety concerns. We'll need to be rigorous
 about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source. Still, we believe
 that building a free society requires that we aim to empower people as much as possible.</p>
<p>The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this
technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a
force focused on replacing large swaths of society.</p>
<p>Meta believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that empowers everyone. We have
the resources and the expertise to build the massive infrastructure required, and the capability
and will to deliver new technology to billions of people across our products. I'm excited to
focus Meta's efforts towards building this future.</p>
