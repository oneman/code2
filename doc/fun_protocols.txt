I like protocols.

DSHOT PROTOCOL

Available modes: Dshot150, Dshot300, Dshot600, Dshot1200.
The number is the bit rate in kHz.

Frame Structure

11 bit throttle: 2048 possible values. 0 is reserved for disarmed.
1-47 are reserved for special commands.
48-2047 (2000 steps) for the actual throttle value
1 bit telemetry request - if this is set, telemetry data is sent back via a separate channel
4 bit CRC: (Cyclic Redundancy) Check to validate data (throttle and telemetry request bit)

Resulting in a frame with the following structure:

SSSSSSSSSSSTCCCC (16 bits, MSB transmitted first)

Pause (output low) between frames: 21 bits recommended, 2 minimum

Bit Structure

A bit period (6.667 us for Dshot150) is split in 8 equal parts. A zero-bit is encoded as 3H 5L, and a one-bit is encoded as 6H 2L.

MIDI PROTOCOL

According to the MIDI protocol, MIDI devices communicate by sending each other
MIDI messages. MIDI messages are sequences of bytes that tell receiving devices
to do something. For example, the following sequence of three bytes is one
possible message.

0x90 0x26 0x3C

The first byte is 0x90. The 9 tells the receiving device to play a note and 0
specifies that the note should be on channel 0. The note is 0x26, which is the
note D in the third or so octave from the bottom. The velocity (e.g., volume)
with which the note should be played is 0x3C, which is about middle. Thus, this
message tells the device to start playing the note D on channel 0 with medium
volume.
