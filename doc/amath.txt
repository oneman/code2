My fellow American Mathematicians, I would like to report in this brief series
of letters about a short series of digits, eleven as a matter of fact. Three
three six four one nine is an odd six digit prime number, the sum of its digits
is 26, which we note for later, as this turns out to be key to unlocking the
ancient knowledge, anyways there is only so much time in a day for paying
attention to recreational numerology, 86400 seconds as a matter of fact, and the
last 5 digits of our eleven digit number, thus we have constructed 33642086400,
each side of this number sums to 18, thus a total 36. Anyway clearly 33642086400
is a number of bits and thus 4205260800 would be its corresponding number of
bytes, and really this series of digits is shorter and centered around 26 rather
than zero which is a nice thing about 4205260800.

It is very important to rememember how much time everyone is wasting larping and
shirking away on really stupid numbers, so we show why is 4205260800 so clever.
1920*1080*3*26*26=4205260800, thus 4205260800 bytes is 676 hd rgb frames, if one
has a perfect hd photographic memory at 60p, then given a moment of 26 seconds
length, you have plenty of time to watch and recall the whole system.
49920p is smaller than a vera rubin frame.
